njorak wayland xkb

Fedora 25 includes wayland as the default display backend and this time around it actually looks to be a decent replacement. However my xmodmap config that I have carried around for years at this point was not going to work anymore.

xmodmap even being deprecated for xorg is not likely to be ported to wayland so the option remaining is to dig into the madness that is xkb.

Stuff I had to do to make it work
Add a new variant

add definition in /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/se

partial alphanumeric_keys
xkb_symbols "njorak" {
    include "us(dvorak)"
    name[Group1]= "Swedish (Njorak, level3 dead keys)";

    key <AD01> { [apostrophe, quotedbl, dead_acute, dead_diaeresis ] };
    key <TLDE> { [grave, asciitilde, dead_grave, dead_tilde ] };

    key <AC06> { [d, D, aring, Aring] };
    key <AC07> { [h, H, adiaeresis, Adiaeresis]     };
    key <AC08> { [t, T, odiaeresis, Odiaeresis]     };
};

and register it in /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/evdev.xml

<variant>
  <configItem>
    <name>njorak</name>
    <description>Swedish (Njorak, level3 dead keys)</description>
  </configItem>
</variant>

Configure gnome to use it

The relevant keys in gsettings are

/org/gnome/desktop/input-sources/sources
    list should include 'se+njorak'
/org/gnome/desktop/input-sources/xkb-options
    option to configure lv3 switch e.g "lv3:lalt_switch"
